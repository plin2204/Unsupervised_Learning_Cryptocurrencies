# Unsupervised_Learning_Cryptocurrencies
Analyze Cryptocurrency data by using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques

## Steps
•	*Preprocess data* for Unsupervised Learning. <br>
•	Cluster data using the **K-means** algorithm.  <br>
•	Determine the best amount of centroids for K-means using the **Elbow Curve**. <br>
•	Use **PCA** to limit features and speed up the model. 

## Discussion
How Cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a Classification for developing new investment product.
